# Transit planning

The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm for creating the most "efficient" road network between a given set of points by creating, destructing and modifying existing roads. 

### Roads 

Roads are the only way citizens can travel through the map, they allow the flow of cars between two cities. Each road has a few fundamental properties, a length and a capacity, there are three main type of roads capacities:

1. Type zero roads: No road between two points;
2. Type I roads: the most basic type of roads, allowing a flow capacity of 5 cars per minute at each direction;
3. Type II roads: roads with better infrastructure, allowing 15 cars per minute at each direction.
